# Digit Recognition Assignment

This project demonstrates how to build a neural network using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The model is a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.

- Dataset: MNIST (28x28 grayscale images of digits 0-9)
- Framework: TensorFlow and Keras
- Features: Data normalization, one-hot encoding, training, evaluation, and prediction
- Comments: Each line of code is explained in the notebook for better understanding

You can find the complete code in the `Assignment1.ipynb` notebook.
